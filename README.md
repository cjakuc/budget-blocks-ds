## Communicating with the API

### /transactions
* The transaction object comes from the get request from the PLAID API (dealt on the web side).

  * Specifically, the "transactions" key from the transaction object from the PLAID API

* Specifying the `user_id` key tells the API to use that user's categorical preferences.
  * If a `user_id` doesn't exist in the database, the API creates the user in the users table and gives that user the default budget blocks categories.

* Example response:
```
{
  "transactions": [
    {
      "account_id": "k9VvjL1Eq3Cnk8gaQXDXt3aRVe7DaGiWekXgz",

```

### /census
* Web team will grab the location from the user's account on Budget Blocks and pass the location parameters to the `location` key.
  * The parameters must have a city and state (abbreviation or full name), zipcode does not work with the API.

* Specifying the `user_id` tells the API to use the users categorical preferences to categorize the census data to their preferences.

* Example response:
```
{
  "City": "New York",
  "Personal": 2304.0833333333335,
  "Food": 725.5,
  "Debt": 0,
  "Income": 8409.25,
  "Giving": 125.66666666666667,
  "Housing": 1950.5833333333335,
  "Transportation": 707.75,
  "Transfer": 0,
  "Savings": 2595.666666666666
}
```

### /update_users
* `Plaid_cats` is needed so the API knows which PLAID category it's going to be moving.

* `old_BB` is the current location of the PLAID category which is the value of the key `Plaid_cats`

* `new_BB` is the location where that user wants to move that PLAID category to.

* Specifying the `user_id` will re-categorize a specific transaction for just that user.
  * __When the user has changed a transaction category, that user will not get the latest updates from the master categories if they are changed__

* Example response:
```
{
  "message": "Updated preferences successfully"
}
```
### /reset_user
* Resets a user's categorical preferencesvia their `user_id`

* Can be used if the user wants the latest update from the master categories if they want to __overwrite their custom categories__

### /delete_user
* Deletes a user from the database if that `user_id` exists in the database

* Deleting a user and using requests such as `/reset_user` and `/update_users` will throw an internal error since the user does not exists in the user DB.
 * A user can be re-created if the transactions from the deleted user were ran through the `/transaction` post request again.
 * If the user that was deleted had custom categories and was re-created using `/transactions`, the user will be given the default master categories.

### /admin routes

<img src="https://i.gyazo.com/68dfce0ec1ef3ea7dc1c24fbbf7506ea.gif" width=750>

* `/admin` is a route to all the admin routes to our API
  * Login information will be stored in the PVD

* `/admin/reset_user` and `/admin/reset_master` will completely wipe all changes and will set everything back to "factory defaults"
  * There is a conformation if you are accessing the `/reset_master` or `/reset_user` through the admin panel just in case you click on it by accident.
  
<img src="https://i.gyazo.com/fb1502198593c6aae3f8019ad98c2e06.gif" width=750>  

* When using `/admin/edit_master` the separate plaid categories are noted by the word `AND` in all caps.
  * Example: `Bar AND Sports Bar`; `Sports Bar` is a sub category of `Bar` in PLAID.
